This file contains a detailed description of the Aa-machine version 0.1,
including the two file formats (story and saved game) and the bytecode
semantics. Be warned that the description is technically comprehensive and
rather condensed.

These are early days, and everything is subject to change.


Runtime data
============

Words:

	Most data is organized into words. A word is currently always 16 bits.
	When words are stored in a save file, the byte order is big-endian.

	The internal format of a 16-bit word could be:

		* A raw 16-bit value, such as an index into one of the heap
		areas.

		* 16 independent flags, numbered 0..15 starting with the most
		significant bit.

			The unconventional bit order works together with
			big-endian byte ordering to allow interpreters to work
			with word-addressing or byte-addressing when dealing
			with flag numbers.

		* A live value (tagged reference), as follows:

			0001..1fff	Object
			2000..3dff	Word, index into dictionary
			3e00..3eff	Word, single character
			3f00		[] (empty list)
			3f01..3fff	reserved
			4000..7fff	Integer in the range 0..16383
			8000..9fff	Indirect reference (index into heap)
			a000..bfff	reserved
			c000..dffe	Pair (index into heap)
			e000..fffe	Word, extended (index into heap)

		* A stored value, as follows:

			0000		Unset (Null)
			0001..7fff	Literal value as above
			8000..fffe	Index into long-term storage area

		* Part of a serialized data stream:

			0000		End of stream marker
			0001..7fff	Literal value as above
			8000		Unbound variable
			8001..80ff	reserved
			8100		Extended word marker
			8101..bfff	reserved
			c000..dfff	Proper list marker
			e000..fffe	Improper list marker

		The special value 3f3f marks unused words in the main heap,
		aux, and random access areas. This is handy for measuring peak
		memory usage.

Text:

	The game-specific CHARACTER SET is a single-byte encoding.
		00-1f are reserved. Some represent special keypresses:
			08	backspace/delete
			0d	return
			10	up
			11	down
			12	left
			13	right
		20-7e correspond to the ASCII characters
		7f    is reserved
		80-ff are game-specific

	Characters 80-ff are mapped to unicode glyphs by a game-specific
	"character mapping table".

	Characters from the CHARACTER SET may appear in input, dictionary
	words, and output. As part of input processing, characters are
	converted to lowercase. The character mapping table contains
	information about case conversion for letters other than A-Z.

	Strings are sequences of printable characters (20-7e, 80-ff), packed
	into bit streams according to a Huffman-inspired encoding.

		* Characters in the ranges 20-7e and 80-9f (ASCII and 32 other
		  glyphs as per the character mapping table) have a compact,
		  variable-length encoding.

		* Characters in the range 9f-ff are represented by a less
		  efficient (but simpler) encoding.

	There is a game-specific bitstream decoding tree with up to 128 nodes
	(see LANG).

Game state:

	Unsaved data:

		* Most output state (Style, screen contents, ...)
		* Runtime flags (transcript, trace, uppercase)
		* TMP (global register used during some recursive operations)

	With the exception of the random access area (see below), this data is
	not directly addressable by runtime code, so interpreters are free to
	work with a different internal representation at runtime.

	Special-purpose registers:

		LONG		INST	Instruction pointer
		LONG		CONT	Continuation pointer

		WORD		TOP	Main heap top
		WORD		ENV	Env frame pointer
		WORD		CHO	Choice frame pointer
		WORD		SIM	Simple cut or null

		WORD		AUX	Aux stack pointer
		WORD		TRL	Trail stack pointer

		WORD		STA	Stoppable aux pointer
		WORD		STC	Stoppable choice pointer

		BYTE		CWL	Collect-words level
		BYTE		SPC	(enum: auto < nospace <
					pendingspace < space < line < par)

	General-purpose registers:

		WORD[64]	R00-R3f	Registers (args, temps, constants,
					globals) (R3f is IDX)

		Suggested global register allocation (i.e. used by dialogc):

			R00..R0c	Arguments (with optional just-pointer)
			R0d..R3c	Temporary values
			R3d		Quick temporary register
			R3e		Constant [] (3f00)

	Saved output state:

		WORD		Number of active divs
		WORD[n]		Active divs (class ids), outermost first

	The main chunk of saved data follows. The game state must conform to
	this format during restart, save and restore operations (including the
	big-endian byte ordering).

	Initialized registers:

		WORD		NOB	Number of objects
		WORD		LTB	Long-term heap bottom (index into
					random access area)
		WORD		LTT	Long-term heap top (index into random
					access area)

	Random access area:

		This memory is addressable, and it may contain pointers in the
		form of word offsets into itself.

		WORD				Word offset of global data
		WORD[NOB]			Word offset of per-object data
		WORD[HEAD.ramsz - NOB - 1]	Data

		The word offset of a data field is given by the following
		pseudo-code:

		def field_addr(field, obj):
			if(obj > NOB) {
				runtime_error
			} else {
				return ram[obj] + field
			}

		When reading, non-null non-objects should return zero:

		def read_field(field, obj):
			if(obj > NOB) {
				return 0;
			} else {
				return ram[ram[obj] + field]
			}

	Heaps:

		WORD[HEAD.auxsz]	Auxiliary heap (aux, trail)
		WORD[HEAD.heapsz]	Main heap (heap, env, choice)

	Saved games contain a RAM area that matches the layout described here
	(starting with 'Initialized registers'). The on-disk representation
	is a run-length encoded xor difference with the contents of the INIT
	chunk (padded by copies of the 'unused' word, 3f3f).

	It is possible to track the game state in RAM in the same format at
	runtime, although it may be more efficient to represent words in the
	native byte order.

	--

	Long-term storage
	
		The long-term storage area is part of the random access area,
		specifically all the words from LTB (inclusive) to LTT
		(exclusive).

		Data in the long-term storage area is organized into chunks:

		WORD		n	Size in words of this chunk
		WORD			Pointer to owner reference (index into
					random access area)
		WORD[n - 2]		Serialized data

		These chunks can move around at runtime (see psuedo-code for
		clear_longterm() below). When this happens, pointers are
		updated in the random access area.

	Env frame format (from lower to higher heap index):

		WORD		Saved ENV
		WORD		Saved SIM
		LONG		Saved CONT
		WORD[]		Local variables

	Choice frame format (from lower to higher heap index):

		WORD		Saved ENV
		WORD		Saved SIM
		LONG		Saved CONT
		LONG		Failure handler
		WORD		Saved CHO
		WORD		Saved TOP
		WORD		Saved TRL
		WORD[]		Saved arguments

	Stop frame format (from lower to higher aux index):

		WORD		Saved STA
		WORD		Saved STC


Savefile
========

Saved games are stored in an IFF format, with form identifier "AASV" and the
following chunks. HEAD must be the first chunk inside the form.

	HEAD		Story file header
	DATA		Compressed game state
	REGS		Registers and active divs

HEAD:

	The contents of this chunk must exactly match the HEAD chunk of the
	story file.

DATA:

	Take the game state (including the full extent of the heaps), then
	exclusive-or with the contents of the INIT chunk padded with the
	'unused' word (0x3f3f). This stream of bytes is run-length encoded in
	the following way: A non-null byte is represented by itself. A stretch
	of N (1..256) null-bytes is represented by a null-byte, followed by a
	byte of value N - 1.

REGS:

	WORD[64]	State of the general-purpose registers
	BYTE[26]	State of the special-purpose registers
	WORD		Number of active divs
	WORD[n]		Active divs (class ids), outermost first

The game state is stored as part of the SAVE opcode, and the saved value of
INST is taken from one of the operands. In addition, interpreters may save
during any ongoing GET_INPUT or GET_KEY operation. In that case, the saved INST
must point to the GET_INPUT or GET_KEY instruction, so that it will execute
again when the game is restored.

Interpreters may create additional chunks describing the current output state.
These can be in any format, and should probably include the name and version of
the interpreter. Unrecognized chunks must be ignored on loading.


Story file
==========

The story file is in IFF format, with form identifier "AAVM" and the following
chunks. HEAD must be the first chunk inside the form. In the following table,
'*' marks the chunks that participate in the story checksum.

	HEAD		File header

	CODE	*	Bytecode instructions
	DICT	*	Game dictionary
	INIT	*	Initial game state, also needed for save/restore
	LANG	*	Character set, bitstream decoder, word endings
	LOOK	*	Style sheet
	MAPS	*	Word-to-object maps
	META		(optional) Story metadata
	TAGS		(optional) Internal object names
	WRIT	*	Compressed text

An interpreter may regard the entire story file as being mapped into a single,
contiguous read-only address space, and add the corresponding file offset to
addresses within the chunks. Or it could regard each chunk as a separate
address space.

HEAD:
	BYTE[2]		version	File format version (major, minor)
	BYTE		wordsz	Word size (currently always 2)
	BYTE		shift	Shift amount for short/long string pointers

	BYTE[2]		release	Story release number
	BYTE[6]		serial	Story serial number

	BYTE[4]		crc	Running CRC-32 of the contents of LOOK, LANG,
				MAPS, DICT, INIT, CODE, and WRIT, in that
				specific order

	WORD		heapsz	Size (in words) of heap/env/choice area
	WORD		auxsz	Size (in words) of aux/trail area
	WORD		ramsz	Size (in words) of random access area
				(including long-term heap)

	BYTE[46]	ifid	(optional) "UUID://...//" + null-byte

INIT:

	This chunk corresponds to the format of the game state detailed above,
	starting with the 'Initialized registers'. Words are stored in
	big-endian byte order. The chunk can be smaller than the RAM area.
	Remaining words are assumed to be filled with the 'unused' value
	(0x3f3f).

LANG:

	BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of bitstream decoding table
	BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of extended character table
	BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of word endings decoder
	BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of stop characters

	Bitstream decoding table:

		BYTE[][2]	Up to 128 2-byte entries. Entry 0 is the root.

		Each entry:
		xxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy	If the bit was 0, perform x, otherwise
					perform y.

		An individual byte in the table is decoded as follows:
		00..5e, 60..7f	Character 0x20 + x
		5f		Character 0x80 + x where
					x follows in the stream
						(7 bits, msb first)
					x >= 0x20
		80		End of string
		81..ff		Go to table entry x - 0x80

	Extended character table:

		BYTE		Number of extended characters
		{
			BYTE		Corresponding lowercase character
						(can be the same)
			BYTE		Corresponding uppercase character
						(can be the same)
			BYTE[3]		Unicode codepoint
		}

	Word endings decoder (an array of instruction bytes)

		00	Fail
		01	Check
		xx yy	Shift xx, jump yy

		Fail: The word is not valid. Shift all letters and create an
		unrecognized word.

		Check: If the word is in the dictionary, succeed (with the
		current ending).

		Shift xx, jump yy: If the last character is xx, then move it to
		the ending and resume execution at byte offset yy in the
		decoder.

	Stop characters

		BYTE[]		Null-terminated set of characters that will be
				treated as separate words when parsing player
				input.

DICT:

	WORD			Number of dictionary words
	{
		BYTE		Length (2..255)
		BYTE[2]		Start of characters (offset in chunk)
	}

	Strings of characters referenced by the dictionary. Can overlap each
	other.

MAPS:

	BYTE[2]			Number of word-to-object maps
	{
		BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of word-to-object map
	}

	Each word-to-object map:

	BYTE[2]		Number of entries (sorted by index value)
	{
		WORD	Index value (dictionary word)
		WORD	Single object id + 0xe000, offset in chunk of payload,
			or null (for wildcard words such as 'the')
	}

	Payload data:

	00		End
	01..df		Short object id (0001..00df)
	e0..ff xx	Long object id (0001..1fff)

LOOK:

	BYTE[2]			Number of style classes
	{
		BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of style definition
	}

	Each style definition consists of zero or more null-terminated CSS
	key-value pairs without the final semicolon, e.g. "width: 100%". The
	original case from the Dialog source code is preserved, so interpreters
	must perform case-insensitive comparison. Leading whitespace has been
	removed from the entries. A blank entry (just the terminating
	null-byte) marks the end.


TAGS: (optional)

	WORD			Number of named objects
	{
		BYTE[2]		Offset in chunk of null-terminated object name
	}

	Strings of characters for the object names.

META: (optional)

	BYTE			Number of entries
	{
		BYTE		Identifier
		BYTE[]		Null-terminated string (variable length)
	}

	Identifiers:

	01	Story title
	02	Story author
	03	Story noun
	04	Story blurb (double linefeed is a paragraph break)
	05	Release date in YYYY-MM-DD format
	06	Compiler version string

WRIT:

	A byte-addressable read-only chunk containing packed bitstreams.
	Streams always begin on a byte boundary. Bits are packed into bytes
	starting with the MSB. Extra null-bytes can be inserted to make better
	use of packed addressing modes.

CODE:

	A byte-addressable read-only chunk, up to 8 MB in size, containing
	bytecode instructions.

	Address 0 must always contain the FAIL instruction. Interpreters may
	thus intercept branches to address 0 and trigger a failure condition
	immediately, which may be faster.

	Address 1 is the program/error entry point. The error code is passed as
	a tagged integer in register R00. For regular program entry, R00 is
	null.

	An opcode is always one byte, and it determines the number and format
	of subsequent operands. The MSB of the opcode often distinguishes
	between two variants of the same operation. This gives interpreter
	authors a choice between dispatching on the entire byte (256 table
	entries), or dispatching on the lower seven bits (128 table entries),
	and then branching on the MSB at a later stage while processing the
	instruction.

	Operand types (always big-endian byte ordering):

	BYTE: (e.g. number of slots to allocate, small constants, ...)
		xxxxxxxx

	VBYTE: (raw constant value, displayed as value in disassembly)
		xxxxxxxx

	WORD: (raw constant value, line number, ...)
		xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx		(depending on word size, which
						is currently always 2)

	VALUE:
		0xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx		Constant 0000-7fff
		10xxxxxx			Value of register 00..3f
		11xxxxxx			Value of env slot 00..3f

	DEST:
		00xxxxxx			Store into register 00..3f
		01xxxxxx			Store into env slot 00..3f
		10xxxxxx			Unify with register 00..3f
		11xxxxxx			Unify with env slot 00..3f

	INDEX:
		0xxxxxxx			Index 00..7f
		10xxxxxx			Index 80..bf
		11xxxxxx xxxxxxxx		Index 0000..3fff

	CODE:
		00000000			Absolute address 0 (known to
						contain the FAIL opcode)
		00xxxxxx			Close relative pointer
						(+ 1..3f bytes)
		01xxxxxx xxxxxxxx		Relative pointer (+/- 8 kB),
						relative to end of operand
		1xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx	Absolute pointer (full 8 MB
						range)

	STRING:
		0xxxxxxx			Tiny pointer (shift by 1, i.e.
						reaches 256 bytes)
		10xxxxxx xxxxxxxx		Short pointer (shift according
						to header)
		11xxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx	Long pointer (shift according
						to header)

	Decoding of a CODE operand can sometimes can be postponed until after
	the execute stage, when it may be possible to decode straight into INST
	or skip the operand altogether.

	0x	Execution flow
	1x	Live data manipulation, stoppable environments
	2x	Random access data manipulation

Examples
========

	To traverse children (A1 is incoming parent):

		LOAD_VAL	A1.'child', >T1
		JUMP		entry
	loop
		POP_CHOICE	#2
		ASSIGN		A1, >T1
	entry
		LOAD_WORD	T1.'sibling', >A1
		IF_RAW_EQ	0, A1, last
		PUSH_CHOICE	#2, loop
	last
		ASSIGN		T1, =A0
		...

	To traverse a list of flagged objects:

		LOAD_VAL	0.'root', >T1
		JUMP		entry
	loop
		POP_CHOICE	#2
		ASSIGN		A1, >T1
	entry
		LOAD_WORD	T1.'next', >A1
		IF_RAW_EQ	0, A1, last
		PUSH_CHOICE	#2, loop
	last
		ASSIGN		T1, =A0
		...

	To flag object A0 with list:

		IF_FLAG		A0.'flag', skip
		SET_FLAG	A0.'flag'
		LOAD_WORD	0.'root', >T0
		STORE_WORD	A0.'next', T0
		STORE_VAL	0.'root', A0
	skip

	To clear object A0 with list:

		IFN_FLAG	A0.'flag', skip
		RESET_FLAG	A0.'flag'
		UNLINK		0.'root', 'next', A0
	skip

	To clear list of flagged objects:

		LOAD_WORD	0.'root', >T1
		IF_RAW_EQ	0, T1, skip
	loop
		RESET_FLAG	T1.'flag'
		LOAD_WORD	T1.'next', >T1
		IFN_NULL	T1, loop
		STORE_WORD	0.'root', #0
	skip

	To clear a property for every object:

		ASSIGN		max_obj_id, >T1
	loop
		STORE_VAL	T1.'prop', #0
		DEC_RAW		T1, >T1
		IFN_NULL	T1, loop

	To select 'then at random' with four choices:

		LOAD_BYTE	0.'state', >R3f
		CHECK_GT_EQ	#3, random, last
		INC_RAW		R3f, >T0
		JMP		done
	last
		ASSIGN		#7, >T0
		JMP		done
	random
		SUB_RAW		R3f, #4, >R3f
		RAND_RAW	#0, #2, >T0
		CHECK_GT	T0, noadjust
		INC_RAW		T0, >T0
	noadjust
		ASSIGN		T0, >R3f
		ADD_RAW		T0, #4, T0
	done
		STORE_BYTE	0.'state', T0

		CHECK_EQ	#1, case1
		CHECK_EQ	#2, case2
		CHECK_EQ	#3, case3
	case0
		...
